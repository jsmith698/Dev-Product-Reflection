    <pre>
        When it came to the development of both qwxt and tap-to-reply, the team wanted to make an app that made it to where responses to a question
        were to the point, short, less time consuming, and actually answer the question which is why we had made it to where the user can just 
        choose the responses by clicking on a button which will instantly display the response to the question.

        <h2 id="page name">Css and Qwxt App Issues</h2>
    </div>
    <pre>
        Like any product, there were issues and obstacles that we had to face in the development of the product. For starters on the team had their 
        own assigned tasks that were put into cards on our project board and my tasks was mostly working with css. These tasks had include: 

        - Add animations to qwxt to make the message and send bubbles flowier
        - Change placement of message and send where message is on the left and send is on the right
        - Add the classes to qwxt to make both the message and send bubbles work

        So the issue with css had started after I had copied the code from tap-to-reply and pasted it into qwxt's css because we had decided for 
        qwxt to have the same message and send bubbles, color, and alignment as tap-to-reply. However, when I ran the code, the message and send
        changed to it's correct colors but it wasn't changing to a bubble shape and they didn't align either. I checked to make sure I had put
        the same class which is called pstyle in qwxt's app just like tap-to-replys app and I did. I look back at tap-to-reply's code and copy 
        some more code that's called import, use, and root and pasted it to qwxt's css. When I go to test it again, the message and send turned
        into bubbles and they were both aligned correctly; however, the message would display the question but the responses and the send would
        display and error message instead of the response choices. It turned out that the issue was not on my end and that it was because Ben who
        was working on the qwxt app along side Noah had not updated the code on his end and in order to update the code, it had to be
        pushed. Once it was updated I pulled the code which updated on my end and saved any changes that were made to the qwxtapp and tried running
        it again. When I ran it again it finally worked, the message displayed the question, the responses displayed the choices, and when I 
        clicked on one of the response choices, the send displayed the chosen reponse that I showed. The message and send were in the shape of text 
        bubbles and were both aligned correctly so the qwxtapp was working perfectly again and the design of the app looked exactly how we wanted it 
        to look.

        <h2 id="page name">Team Meeting Conflict</h2>
    </div>

    <pre>
        When it comes to the team, we mostly had our meetings either via zoom or google meet but there were never any problems where one of us
        got into a dispute or disagreement, we all mostly got along with one another. The only conflict I can think of is when it comes to work or 
        other group projects in other classes. There was one time where we had a meeting at 7 but I was busy with another group meeting in a 
        another class but it was handled by me letting my members know that I was at another group meeting and that I was going to be late
        in joining the online meeting. Another incident was when we would have meetings over the weekend and Taylor would let us know that she had 
        to work that day in which we all handled it by rescheduling the meeting for the next day when Taylor didn't have work or earlier in the day 
        before she had to leave for work. Those were really minor issues that were easily handled but other than that the team had no 
        problems with one another besides a few meeting scheduling issues.

        <h2 id="page name">Product Development Environment and Process</h2>
    </div>

    <pre>
        In the developement of the product, the team had started off using node js but realized that it didn't do well with css and js so we 
        changed to php since it can handle it better and decided to put the app on heroku. So when someone goes to the teams github page, they
        can click on the heroku link that's located on the right of the page and it will lead them to the qwxt and tap-to-reply app where they 
        can typed their question and choose the reponse choices as a way to answer the question. How we would run and test our product, we would 
        start up xammp apache and then type our team folder name that was located in the xammp htdocs folder as a local host and it would pull up 
        our app and run it that way. So before we would work on the product we would always discuss what stuff we need to fix or add and we would
        write this down as a issue and/or card on our project board on github and we would look at the issues and cards and work on what we had 
        written down that needed to be either fixed or added and after we got through fixing and adding to our product, we would close the issue 
        and/or drag our card to the completed section of our project board. If we are still in the middle of working on it, we would drag the card
        to the in progress section. The process of how we go about discussing and implementing into our product helps tell how the team operated
        in our step by step process of how we went about working on the product. The product itself helps the user understand how both the apps 
        work and operate including providing story cards and information on the main pages of what it's suppose to do and how beneficial it is to
        the user.
